Description: Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) is a method used in 
    Bayesian neural networks developped by Goulet et al. (2020). This package is 
    its R implementation. From TAGI, the package enables inference of the weights 
    and baises posterior distributions, treats uncertainty in all layers and uses  
    a single observation at a time for online inference of model parameters. It 
    supports many activation functions and can solve regression problems.
